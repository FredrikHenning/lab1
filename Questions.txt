Question 1: What is the output of your program? That is, what hardware (renderer) do
	    you have, and what OpenGL version does it support?

Answer: My computer uses: 
		Renderer: GeForce GTX 1660 Ti/PCIe/SSE2
		Version Supported: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 457.49

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: Which usage flag did you select, and why?

Answer: GL_STATIC_DRAW since the data will only be modified once but probably used 
	many times.

Question 3: Which dimensions (left, right, etc) in the screen space (that is, in 
	    the window on your screen) do the x, y and z coordinates of your vertex 
	    position attributes map to?

Answer: Origo is in the middle of the window, then the x-axis goes left to -1 and 
	right to 1, y-axis goes up and down to 1 and -1, z-axis is in and out of the 
	window from -1 to 1. How it could be determined that -1 is in and 1 is out of 
	the window was thanks to different values given to the z values in the vertexes 
	to see how the triangle reacted.

Question 4: What are the limits for x and y and what happens if you exceed them?

Answer: Already mentioned before that the limits are -1 and 1, if it exceeds the 
	limits then the triangle will be cut of at the lines the window is sized. 
	So a new weird form is shown.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5: What are the limits for z and what happens if you exceed them? Why? 
            (It has to do with normalised device coordinates.)

Answer: Same as before, the parts of the triangle that is outside the bounds will 
	be cut out (clipping) and a new shape will be showed to us. The bounds are 
	(-1 -> 1) for all axes since the nomalised device coordinates has it as standard.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6: Should the matrices be multiplied as M × V × P or P × V × M? Why?

Answer: PVM is the correct way to multiply them since matrix multiplication is
	read right-left. (I added a brackets to be safe)
